Key dates for development of Fourier-fit (or whatever it becomes):

today: 8th October

Key features to add to the code:
  - Split the code into Fourier functions and the X-ray processing script [before 26th November].
  - Polynomial background described as fourier series. [before 26th November].
  - Write output/input scripts for X-ray data processing [before 26th november].
      - Output script should write:
          - A fit file for each diffraction pattern. This conatins the fitted parameters for each peak that includes: the fitting boundaries (i.e. max and min d), fitted parameters and their errors. 
          - A file in the multifit format to be used by multifit for the stress/strain fitting.
          - 
      - Input script: Required files:
          - List of all diffraction patterns to fit.
          - One of: (a) last fit as initial guess, or (b) default input file containing limits and orders of the fits only.

  - Implement the fitting of multiple peaks in the same window. Each peak should have independent 'h' and 'd'. It is usual in this sort of fitting to allow 'w' to be the same for all peaks -- we should probably have an option to do this. [not required but would be much better if it was implemented - also it might be easier to implement it sooner so that we dont have to rework lots of code].
  - GUI front end for X-ray data. [not required by 26th November but if have working version by 10th Dec can be included in talk.]
  - Lorentz peak functions (again described by Fourier series and with a weighting between Gauss and Lorentx peak shapes, also a Fourier) [not required before 26th November].
  - Read calibrations for GSAS-II, Dioptas, Dawn. [only GSAS-II required by 26th November].
