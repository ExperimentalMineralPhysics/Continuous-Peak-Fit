File format and data structure for X-ray files.

Files needed:
  1. Generic input file (ascii).
  2. Fit-save file (either as a ascii file but probably better as the data structure passed around in the scripts.)
  3. Multifit/polydefix data file.
  4. Possibly other output formats depending what post-processing software is required/requested.


Generic input file.
Should be an ascii file so that can be edited without a GUI.
Needs to contain:
  - Calibration type (e.g. GSAS-II, Fit2D etc...) and file location/name
      - Any additional information that is not recorded in the Calibration file. (e.g. pixel size of detector).
  - Mask type and file location/name
  - File listing XRD patterns to process -- location/name
    - For each window/sub-pattern:
        - extent min and max
        - Background description:
              degree of the polynomial Background
              Number of Fourier terms
        - number of peaks
          - For each peak the order of the fourier series in: (later this could incorporate a range/machine learning switch)
              d-spacing,
              height,
              width,
              Peak Shape (ratio of Gauss or Lorentz)



Fit-save File.
I guess the fit-save file just contains the same information as the generic input file but is populated with fitted parameters.
It does not need to be ASCII formatted.




Multifit/polydefix data file:
This file format is taken from https://github.com/smerkel/multifit

The bits that seem to write the output files from multifit are:
multifit/fitPatternObject.pro -- function fitPatternObject::saveToAscii (line 207)
multifit/subPatternModel.pro -- function SubPatternModel::saveToAscii (line 143)
multifit/fitSubPatternObject.pro -- function fitSubPatternObject::saveToAscii (line 483)

The file has the following structure [numbers/arrays in brackets are mutable and change with the data]:
---
