Contains the directory name where data are:
 * gui directory with graphical user interface files
 * openCL directory with OpenCL kernels
 * calibrants directory with d-spacing files describing calibrants
 * testimages: if does not exist: create it.

This file is very short and simple in such a way to be mangled by installers
It is used by pyFAI.utils._get_data_path

See bug #144 for discussion about implementation
